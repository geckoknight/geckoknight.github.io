A short story

<div class="foreword">
  Dear reader,
  <br />
  thanks for picking up this comic book. A lot of effort was put
into it, the story was formed a long time ago and tried out in
different mediums until time and tools prove themselves to be
a good fit to finally tell this story. Inspired by Nausicaa, Hollow
Knight, the works of Jean “Moebius” Giraud, Fallout, and
countless other small pieces of joy, here comes to you the
journey of a curious soul in a vast world, full of wonders.
Enjoy the trip,<br />

A few years from now, the world may look quite different: A world &hellip;</p>
</div>
<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of a mossy cave town with lightsin the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed_output2.png"><p class="text top-left">

And in such a world plays our little story.</p>
</div>

Deep down under the vines of the forest, &hellip;</p>

</div>
<div class="panel">

It never really left its home but was always curious about life outside.</p>

<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of a mossy cave town with lizards, in the style of Jean Giraud, in the style of moebius_seed_output0.png"><p class="text top-left">

</div>
<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of an lizard underground cave, dark atmosphere, in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed_output0.png"><p class="text top-left">

<div class="panel">

</div>
<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of a cave covered in moss, fairy lightsin the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed_output1.png"><p class="text top-left">

</div>
<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of a mossy cave town with lightsin the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed_output1.png"><p class="text top-left">

</div>
<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of a mossy cave town with lizards, in the style of Jean Giraud, in the style of moebius_seed_output2.png"><p class="text top-left">

<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of cave grave with firefly and mossy ground, in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed_output2.png"><p class="text top-left">
where it gazed towards the sky, hardly able to keep the eyes open.</P>
</div>
<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of cavern with fireflies, in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed_output1.png"><p class="text top-left">

</div>
<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of cave inhabited by fireflies with vines, in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed_output2.png"><p class="text top-left">
The sun was slowly rising as the gecko opened its eyes.</p>
</div>
<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of rocky cave with light from the top, in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed_output2.png"><p class="text top-left">
It climbed a mountain to get a better overview of the surroundings.</P>

<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of a dark outside rocky fortress cave , in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed_output1.png"><p class="text top-left">

</div>
<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of rocky cave with bright light, in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed_output0.png"><p class="text top-left">

</div>
<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of rocky fortress under the ground , in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed_output0.png"><p class="text top-left">

</div>
<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of rocky fortress, in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed_output2.png"><p class="text top-left">
While approaching, the gecko asked itself: Was it inhabited?</p>
</div>
<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of an lizard underground cave, dark atmosphere, in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed_output1.png"><p class="text top-left">

  Dark and sinister, not as inviting from the inside as it seemed from

And then, a dead end: Water.</p>
</div>
<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of an underground cavein the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed_output1.png"><p class="text top-left">
The gecko headed back but got lost in this maze-like structure.</p>

One path after the other he took, &hellip;</p>

<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of a outside hollow cavern , in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed_output0.png"><p class="text top-left">
&hellip; until he saw a bright light.</P>
</div>
<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of a faery dust detailed underground cavern with caverns , in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed33_output0.png"><p class="text top-left">
Finally: the surface.</p>
</div>
<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of a darkrocky fortress inside a cave , in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed_output1.png"><p class="text top-left">
The gecko seemed trapped between huge stony walls.</p>
</div>
<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of a cave town with wood parts, dark atmosphere, in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed_output0.png"><p class="text top-left">
But it found the way to the sky again.</p>
</div>
<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of a vast empty city ruin with caverns , in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed_output1.png"><p class="text top-left">
What was this place? And where were all the trees and plants?</p>
</div>
<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of a vast empty city ruin with caverns , in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed_output0.png"><p class="text top-left">
And as the sun set, the gecko searched for shelter.</p>
</div>
<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of castle undergroundin the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed_output0.png"><p class="text top-left">
  Unable to climb another hill, the gecko just looked for another hole to hide
</div>
<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of a small  desert cave with nightlife and fireflies, in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed_output0.png"><p class="text top-left">
There was something like an entrance.</p>
</div>
<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of a ominous firefly detailed underground cavern with rocks convered in mud, in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed32_output0.png"><p class="text top-left">
Strangely illuminated by fireflies, the gecko rested in this cavern.</p>

<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of a ominous firefly detailed underground cavern with rocks standing in a row , in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed32_output0.png"><p class="text top-left">

</div>
<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of a ominous firefly detailed underground cavern with caverns , in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed32_output0.png"><p class="text top-left">
When he woke up, the sun filled the cavern with light.</p>
</div>
<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of a vast empty city ruin with junkyard, in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed_output2.png"><p class="text top-left">
Again, the gecko travelled the whole day.</p>
</div>
<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of a small  desert cave with junkyard, in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed_output1.png"><p class="text top-left">
The gecko traversed the empty desert.</p>
</div>
<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of a vast empty city ruin with castle ruins, in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed_output1.png"><p class="text top-left">
And came across another strange structure.</p>
</div>
<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of a vast empty city ruin with rocks standing in a row , in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed_output1.png"><p class="text top-left">

<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of a vast empty city ruin with vines, in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed_output2.png"><p class="text top-left">

</div>
<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of a vast empty city ruin with castle ruins, in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed_output2.png"><p class="text top-left">

</div>
<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of a vast empty city ruin with junkyard, in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed_output0.png"><p class="text top-left">
But something was new here: There were objects lying around.</p>
</div>
<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of a vast empty city ruin with junkyard, in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed_output1.png"><p class="text top-left">
Then, the night approached and it was getting dark.</p>
</div>
<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of a vast empty city ruin with castle ruins, in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed_output0.png"><p class="text top-left">
And as the sun set, the gecko recognized towers on the horizon.</p>

<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of a fairy dust ruin at night with rocks standing in a row , in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed33_output0.png"><p class="text top-left">

<IMG SRC="img/painting of a vast empty city ruin with bright light in a jungle, in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed_output0.png"><p class="text top-left">

<IMG SRC="img/painting of a vast empty city ruin with bright light in a jungle, in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed_output2.png"><p class="text top-left">

</div>
<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of a small outside jungle cave with junkyard, in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed_output1.png"><p class="text top-left">
And the jungle was inhabited by other lizards.</p>
</div>
<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of a small outside jungle cave with wooden construction, in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed_output2.png"><p class="text top-left">
A small settlement where the gecko could ask around and relax.</p>

</div>
<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of a small outside jungle cave with nightlife and fireflies, in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed_output1.png"><p class="text top-left">
The gecko asked for shelter and slept peacefully.</p>

<div class="panel">
<IMG SRC="img/painting of an underground rocky cavern with bright light in a jungle, in the style of Jean Giraud moebius_seed36_output0.png"><p class="text top-left">
